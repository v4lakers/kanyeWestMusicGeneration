## Game Instructions
The game is Tic Tac Toe. The first player to place 3 Consecutive symbols (X's for computer and O's for User) either
vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins! More information about Tic Tac Toe can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).


The Computer will always go first and will start the game off with a X in the middle of the board.

As the user, you are permitted to make your move using the keyboard using the keys: Q,W,E,A,S,D,Z,X,C

Concretely, the following keys represent the following positions on the Tic Tac Toe Game Board

Make sure you only select from the valid key options (Q,W,E,A,S,D,Z,X,C) and a space on the board that has 
not been taken yet. If not, the program will re-prompt you to make a valid move. 

The game and program will end in the following ways
1) Computer gets 3 consecutive X's
2) User gets 3 consecutive O's
3) All spaces on the board have been filled with no consecutive triplets of a symbol.

Good Luck! (I have yet to beat the CPU).
